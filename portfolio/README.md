# Portfolio - M. Kharl Parizka Yudha

This is a dummy portfolio package with three example repositories that demonstrate typical
backend engineering patterns: a small Payment API simulator, a Batch Processing demo,
and an API Observability module.

Use these as starting points for GitHub repositories, technical tests, or interview demos.
